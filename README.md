# Lab09 – Ensemble Learning (Voting Classifier)

This lab demonstrates how to use **hard and soft voting classifiers** to improve prediction accuracy through model aggregation. Various base learners like logistic regression, decision trees, and SVM are combined to build a robust ensemble classifier.
